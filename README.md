# Windows Software
Over the years I've found a number of useful Windows tools and software. Here's my attempt to write them down. If you have any tools/software that you recommend, please make a Pull Request and I will merge it! Try to keep all the software Open Source unless there isn't an equal alternative.

First step is to use [Ninite](https://ninite.com/) to install most of the software you need. None of the software on the list is provided via Ninite.


## Tools
